# Traditional Sentiment Analysis

A sentiment analysis project without the use of Machine Learning.

This project was implemented in 2013 based on the Twitter API. A keyword entered into the search box retrieves 100 recent tweets.
These tweets are then stripped of unnecessary text and then analysed for positive or negative sentiment based on the [SentiWordNet 3.0](https://github.com/aesuli/SentiWordNet).

The final result shows a percentage metric basde on whether the sentiment towards the keywork is positive or negative.
